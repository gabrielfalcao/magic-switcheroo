**Rust Crate and command-line companion to switch the magic numbers of a
file with your own magic numbers based on a string of a string containing a "magic" word**

Don't use it in your CTF's, it would be a very bad idea to turn regular files into ".dat" file... ðŸ˜‡ and vice-versa, OF COURSE.
--------------

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   cargo install magic-switcheroo

Usage
-----


As a Library
............

Most of the magic is done within the struct ``MetaMagic`` which works
with a ``Vec<u8>`` most of the time.


Enchanting a Vec<u8>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


As command-line utility
.......................

The crate ships with the binary ``ms`` which provides subcommands to enchant, restore and dump ``MetaMagic`` structs in JSON, among other things.


Enchanting a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   number: a valid integer suffix: smh

.. code:: bash

   ms switch <THEMAGICWORD> <FILE>
